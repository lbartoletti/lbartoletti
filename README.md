### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am LoÃ¯c

I'm a CAD/GIS engineer interested in all things related to open geospatial technologies.
As an OSGeo charter member [1] [2], I actively contribute to the promotion and development of open-source geospatial solutions.
I'm also a FreeBSD [3] [4] ports committer. Member of the Desktop and Python teams. Additionally, I actively participate in improving GIS tools and utilities within the FreeBSD ecosystem.
My development approach focuses on creating solutions that are simple, lightweight, yet effective. I write code in various languages such as C, C++, Python, Nim, and shell scripts.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

#### Professional Projects:

- As a Core Committer for [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), and [SFCGAL](https://sfcgal.org/) at [Oslandia](https://oslandia.com/en/), I'm actively involved in enhancing and maintaining these critical geospatial tools.

- Occasionally, I contribute to other projects within the [OSGeo](https://osgeo.org/) community, focusing on improving various open-source geospatial technologies.

#### Personal Projects:

- I'm currently working on several projects using Nim:

    - **Accurate Floating Point Sums and Products**: A library for fixed-point calculations. [AccurateSums](https://gitlab.com/lbartoletti/accuratesums)

    - **Fixed-Point Number Library**: A library for fixed-point arithmetic. [FixedPointNumber (fpn)](https://gitlab.com/lbartoletti/fpn)

    - Soon, I'll be releasing a geometry library to complement these projects.

- Additionally, I'm involved in embedded systems development.

- I have a passion for testing old systems, influenced by my background in history, and I enjoy optimizing them to utilize minimal resources.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

- [ADA](https://ada-lang.io/)

- [Idris / Type Driven Development](https://www.idris-lang.org/)

- And maybe oneday a Lisp language

- And still re learning C, C++, Python and Nim
